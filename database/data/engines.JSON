The XLR81 family was derived from the Bell Hustler Rocket Engine, originally developed for use on an air-to-surface missile. Early engines were nearly identical to the Hustler engine, while later variants offered new capabilities and improved performance. Engine restart was introduced on the Agena B's XLR81-BA-7 (Model 8081). The XLR81-BA-11 (Model 8096) used on Agena D used propellant sumps to eliminate the need for ullage thrust. The XLR81-BA-13 (Model 8247) powered the Gemini Agena Target Vehicle (a modified Agena D) and was rated for up to 14 restarts.",

    "seriesDescription": "A staged combustion hydrolox upper stage engine intended for use on the N-1M and considered for use on Proton and Angara, eventually licensed to India for its GSLV MkI and MkII. Later versions were developed by India for domestic use on the as the CE-7.5. The main engine bell is fixed in place and two verniers are used to provide combined pitch-yaw-roll control; this leads to lower control authority than on stages where the main engine can gimbal. This engine runs with a somewhat higher than average O/F ratio, resulting in a denser than average hydrolox stage.",

It was later adapted to replace Delta's Castor 2 boosters, increasing GTO capacity from 1593 lb (723 kg) to nearly 2000 lb (900 kg). The resulting Delta 3000-series launched in 1975 and was the first to adopt a staggered booster staging sequence. Previous Delta vehicles burned their motors in a 6-3 sequence and then jettisoned all SRMs at once. The heavier and longer-burning Castor 4 required that the ground-lit motors be jettisoned immediately after depletion to reduce dead weight. Early launches used a less efficient 5-4 sequence to reduce acceleration but returned to a 6-3 sequence after Delta was strengthened in the early 80s.",

This, combined with a stretched first stage (the Extra-Extended Long Tank Thor), and a return to the more efficient 6-3 SRM ignition sequence, improved Delta's performance by 11% over the 3000-series. The Castor 4A was flown on the Delta II from 1989 until 1993, when it was replaced by the GEM 40. The boosters were also used on the Atlas IIAS from 1993 until 2004. Burn time 53 seconds.",

It served as the basis for the early orbital engines of the US, with its lineage carrying on all the way to the 21st century. The LR43 was converted to run on kerosene for Atlas and was later renamed LR89, and the LR79 derivative powered Thor. Late model LR89s were upgraded with RS-27 components for higher efficiency, whereas the RS-27 itself was used on Delta by that point. LR89 configs are comparable to similar-era -79 configs, since they were the same engine underneath.",

It, like the Atlas's booster engines (LR89s), is lit on the ground, but a bit over 2 minutes into flight the boosters are dropped and the Atlas core continues to orbit under the power of the sustainer engine (and the verniers for roll control and final adjustment). The final configuration of the LR105 (like the LR89) uses RS-27 components for increased performance. As a sustainer engine, the LR105 has relatively poor sea level specific impulse compared to most boosters, but somewhat better vacuum specific impulse--though the difference in both is nowhere near as pronounced as when comparing a booster to an upper stage engine.",

It served as the basis for the early orbital engines of the US, with its lineage carrying on all the way to the 21st century. The LR43 was converted to run on kerosene for Atlas and was later renamed LR89, and the LR79 derivative powered Thor. Late model LR89s were upgraded with RS-27 components for higher efficiency, whereas the RS-27 itself was used on Delta by that point. LR89 configs are comparable to similar-era -79 configs, since they were the same engine underneath.",

It, like the Atlas's booster engines (LR89s), is lit on the ground, but a bit over 2 minutes into flight the boosters are dropped and the Atlas core continues to orbit under the power of the sustainer engine (and the verniers for roll control and final adjustment). The final configuration of the LR105 (like the LR89) uses RS-27 components for increased performance. As a sustainer engine, the LR105 has relatively poor sea level specific impulse compared to most boosters, but somewhat better vacuum specific impulse--though the difference in both is nowhere near as pronounced as when comparing a booster to an upper stage engine.",

The S1.5400 was designed for the Blok L stage, the final stage for the Molniya configuration of the R-7, used to launch communication satellites and interplanetary probes. Unlike prior upper stages, it was restartable (this was needed to perform apogee kicks to place Molniya satellites in their final orbits). It was given the industry designation 11D33. An upgraded version, termed 11D33M, had slightly improved performance. The RD-58 is a derivative of the 11D33M engine with higher performance (industry designation 11D58); it has been used on many Russian launchers and is still in use today on Proton and Zenit. In comparison to hydrolox upper stages, kerolox ones do not suffer boiloff as badly and need far less volume (kerosene being far denser than liquid hydrogen), but have much lower specific impulse.",

A later variant (TR-201) was used on Delta as an upper stage engine (on Delta P series); this was a low-cost model with more restarts (4 instead of 2) and slightly higher thrust but lower efficiency and no throttling capability.",

The LR43 was converted to run on kerosene for Atlas and was later renamed LR89, and the LR79 derivative powered Thor.

The XLR81 family was derived from the Bell Hustler Rocket Engine, originally developed for use on an air-to-surface missile. Early engines were nearly identical to the Hustler engine, while later variants offered new capabilities and improved performance. Engine restart was introduced on the Agena B's XLR81-BA-7 (Model 8081). The XLR81-BA-11 (Model 8096) used on Agena D used propellant sumps to eliminate the need for ullage thrust. The XLR81-BA-13 (Model 8247) powered the Gemini Agena Target Vehicle (a modified Agena D) and was rated for up to 14 restarts.",
