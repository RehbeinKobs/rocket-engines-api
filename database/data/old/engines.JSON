The S1.5400 was designed for the Blok L stage, the final stage for the Molniya configuration of the R-7, used to launch communication satellites and interplanetary probes.

It was later adapted to replace Delta's Castor 2 boosters, increasing GTO capacity from 1593 lb (723 kg) to nearly 2000 lb (900 kg). The resulting Delta 3000-series launched in 1975 and was the first to adopt a staggered booster staging sequence. Previous Delta vehicles burned their motors in a 6-3 sequence and then jettisoned all SRMs at once. The heavier and longer-burning Castor 4 required that the ground-lit motors be jettisoned immediately after depletion to reduce dead weight. Early launches used a less efficient 5-4 sequence to reduce acceleration but returned to a 6-3 sequence after Delta was strengthened in the early 80s.",

This, combined with a stretched first stage (the Extra-Extended Long Tank Thor), and a return to the more efficient 6-3 SRM ignition sequence, improved Delta's performance by 11% over the 3000-series. The Castor 4A was flown on the Delta II from 1989 until 1993, when it was replaced by the GEM 40. The boosters were also used on the Atlas IIAS from 1993 until 2004. Burn time 53 seconds.",

It served as the basis for the early orbital engines of the US, with its lineage carrying on all the way to the 21st century. The LR43 was converted to run on kerosene for Atlas and was later renamed LR89, and the LR79 derivative powered Thor. Late model LR89s were upgraded with RS-27 components for higher efficiency, whereas the RS-27 itself was used on Delta by that point. LR89 configs are comparable to similar-era -79 configs, since they were the same engine underneath.",

It, like the Atlas's booster engines (LR89s), is lit on the ground, but a bit over 2 minutes into flight the boosters are dropped and the Atlas core continues to orbit under the power of the sustainer engine (and the verniers for roll control and final adjustment). The final configuration of the LR105 (like the LR89) uses RS-27 components for increased performance. As a sustainer engine, the LR105 has relatively poor sea level specific impulse compared to most boosters, but somewhat better vacuum specific impulse--though the difference in both is nowhere near as pronounced as when comparing a booster to an upper stage engine.",

It, like the Atlas's booster engines (LR89s), is lit on the ground, but a bit over 2 minutes into flight the boosters are dropped and the Atlas core continues to orbit under the power of the sustainer engine (and the verniers for roll control and final adjustment). The final configuration of the LR105 (like the LR89) uses RS-27 components for increased performance. As a sustainer engine, the LR105 has relatively poor sea level specific impulse compared to most boosters, but somewhat better vacuum specific impulse--though the difference in both is nowhere near as pronounced as when comparing a booster to an upper stage engine.",

The S1.5400 was designed for the Blok L stage, the final stage for the Molniya configuration of the R-7, used to launch communication satellites and interplanetary probes. Unlike prior upper stages, it was restartable (this was needed to perform apogee kicks to place Molniya satellites in their final orbits). It was given the industry designation 11D33. An upgraded version, termed 11D33M, had slightly improved performance. The RD-58 is a derivative of the 11D33M engine with higher performance (industry designation 11D58); it has been used on many Russian launchers and is still in use today on Proton and Zenit. In comparison to hydrolox upper stages, kerolox ones do not suffer boiloff as badly and need far less volume (kerosene being far denser than liquid hydrogen), but have much lower specific impulse.",

It served as the basis for the early orbital engines of the US, with its lineage carrying on all the way to the 21st century. The LR43 was converted to run on kerosene for Atlas and was later renamed LR89, and the LR79 derivative powered Thor. Late model LR89s were upgraded with RS-27 components for higher efficiency, whereas the RS-27 itself was used on Delta by that point. LR89 configs are comparable to similar-era -79 configs, since they were the same engine underneath.",
